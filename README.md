# fileOrganizer

This python script simply organizes audio, images, and pdf files into the proper directory once they are install.
I learned about the python scheduling library, along with the os library. I learned that I could run a python file in the background by using the command python3 /path/to/file.py &. Using the schedule library this script runs every 1 minute, but can be adjusted.
